Functions and macros created in an Excel-DNA add-in can be called directly from Excel VBA by using `Application.Run(...)`. However, .NET also supports creating rich object models that are exported as COM libraries, which can be Tools->Referenced in VBA. Excel-DNA has some advanced support to host COM-exported objects from Excel-DNA add-ins, giving some advantages over the regular .NET "Register for COM interop" hosting approach:

* COM objects that are created via the Excel-DNA COM server support will be active in the same AppDomain as the rest of the add-in, allowing direct shared access to static variables, internal caches etc.

* COM registration for classes hosted by Excel-DNA does not require administrative access (even when registered via `RegSvr32.exe`).

* Everything needed for the COM server can be packed in a single-file .xll add-in, including the type library used for IntelliSense support in VBA.

[Mikael Katajam√§ki][mikael-katajamaki] has written some detailed tutorial posts on his [Excel in Finance][mikael-katajamaki] blog that explore this Excel-DNA feature, with detailed explanation, step-by-step instructions, screen shots and further links. See:

* [Interfacing C# and VBA with Excel-DNA (no intellisense support)][post-no-intellisense]
* [Interfacing C# and VBA with Excel-DNA (with intellisense support)][post-with-intellisense]

Note that these techniques would work equally well with code written in VB.NET, allowing you to port VB/VBA libraries to VB.NET with Excel-DNA and then use these from VBA.

Thank you Mikael for the great write-up!
