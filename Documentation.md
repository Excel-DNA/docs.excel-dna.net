## Quick start

Get going with some first steps by following the [Getting Started](Getting Started) page.

To make a C# add-in with Visual Studio consult the [Step-by-step-CSharp-add-in.doc](assets/Step-by-step-CSharp-add-in.doc) guide.

Otherwise, browse through the list of other resources and examples on the [Documentation Home](index) page.

## Samples

[Distribution Samples](https://github.com/Excel-DNA/ExcelDna/tree/master/Distribution/Samples) contains various .dna files, each of which is a self-contained add-in that exhibit some Excel-DNA functionality.
The .dna files are .xml files that can be edited with a regular text editor.
To run any of the sample .dna files, make a copy of the Distribution\ExcelDna.xll file, place it next to the .dna file, and rename to have the same prefix. E.g. to run Optional.dna, make a copy of ExcelDna.xll called Optional.xll, and double-click, or File->Open to load in Excel.

## Support

There is a searchable record of more than 3460 messages on the Google group: [https://groups.google.com/group/exceldna](https://groups.google.com/group/exceldna).

**Please don't hesitate to ask.** If you are stuck or need some help using Excel-DNA your questions really are very welcome - whether you are just getting started, or an Excel-DNA expert.

And if you could help put together some proper documentation, please contact me. I'd be happy to add you as an editor on the Github project.
