With the `HelpTopic` property of the `ExcelFunction` attribute, you can add a pointer to a topic in a .chm help file, or a url with more detailed information.

A project to generate a .chm file from the add-in is available here: [https://github.com/Excel-DNA/ExcelDnaDoc](https://github.com/Excel-DNA/ExcelDnaDoc).
