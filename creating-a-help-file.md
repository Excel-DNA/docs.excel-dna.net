title: Creating a help file

With the _HelpTopic_ property of the _ExcelFunction_ attribute, you can add a pointer to a topic in a .chm help file, or a url with more detailed information.

An independent project to generate a .chm file from the add-in is available here: [https://github.com/mndrake/ExcelDnaDoc](https://github.com/mndrake/ExcelDnaDoc).
